Description: calcpkg 2.1 - ticalc.org Package Manager
        =========================================================
        
        calcpkg is a command line "package manager" for ticalc.org and other websites
        with repositories of Texas Instruments calculator software.
        
        What does that actually mean? Well, let's say you own a TI-83+ graphing
        calculator. The 83+ can be programmed in a handful of languages, such as the
        builtin TI-BASIC scripting language and z80 assembly. Using software such as
        TiLP, you can download programs to your calculator to run them.
        
        ticalc.org is the world's largest collection of TI graphing calculator
        software. It features programs for every calculator model in almost every
        possible language, from the ancient TI-81 to the newest models of TI-Nspire.
        
        This program is a CLI interface to ticalc.org, allowing you to download
        programs from the command line without having to browse the website in a web
        browser. It can be configured to support other repositories as well, and
        currently ships with support for the Omnimaga and Cemetech community sites.
        
        Usage:
        ------
        
        See INSTALL for install instructions.
        
        The first command you should run is an update, to sync the index files:
        
        `$ calcpkg update`
        
        Then, you can search for files:
        
        `$ calcpkg search [query]`
        
        Then, the following command will download any files that match `[query]`:
        
        `$ calcpkg install [query]`
        
        You can narrow your search down with many flags. For instance, if you only want
        to download TI-83+ games, you can use:
        
        `$ calcpkg -g -c 83plus search [query]`
        
        Then, if you want to automatically extract the downloaded .zip archives, you would
        add the -x flag:
        
        `$ calcpkg -x install [query]`
        
        You can also simply count the number of files that match a given query:
        
        `$ calcpkg count [query]`
        
        For full documentation of all command line switches, run:
        
        `$ calcpkg -h`

        While ticalc.org staff members have okayed the use of this program to download
        files from their website, this is not an endorsement of it- the program is
        not written or maintained by them, it's written by me (see Credits).
        
        The same is true for the Cemetech and Omnimaga staff members.
